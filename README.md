## Notice
This script can be weird at times when used on Chrome, though easily fixed Puls3 doesn't use Chrome and as such doesn't notice them, remember to report any bugs you find!

If you have any issues using Violentmonkey's 'check for updates' feature and have been using the script since it was on Greasyfork, then uninstall then reinstall directly from GitHub.

If you don't like DualView or your Pendoria setup makes it look dumb, disable it!

A Lot of features are disabled by default, I suggest looking through them for settings you might like.

## Support
This script is was created for Firefox, not Chrome, Chrome support relies on people reporting errors.

This script was made for Violentmonkey, if you use Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey, I suggest switching.
