If you have any issues using Violentmonkey's 'check for updates' feature and have been using the script since it was on Greasyfork, then uninstall then re-install directly from Github.

## Notice
This script can be weird at times when used on Chrome, though easily fixed Puls3 doesn't use Chrome and as such doesn't notice them, remember to report any bugs you find!

## Settings
The settings can be found at the top of the script.

## Contributing
If you are capable, and have a good idea that you want to implement, feel free to use Github to contribute!
