# Pendorian Elite UI
Changes a large portion of Pendoria's text and UI to 'Elite' blue and makes small changes to the UI.

## Downloads
[Download](https://github.com/Xer0-Puls3/Pendorian-Elite-UI/raw/master/script.user.js)

If you have any issues using Violentmonkey's 'check for updates' feature and have been using the script since it was on Greasyfork, then uninstall then re-install directly from Github.

## Notice
This script can be weird at times when used on Chrome, though easily fixed Puls3 doesn't use Chrome and as such doesn't notice them, remember to report any bugs you find!

If you don't like DualView or your Pendoria setup makes it look dumb, disable it!

## Settings
The settings can be found at the top of the script.
* Toggle Dual View. (Actions and Content at the same time)
* Edit the border line used in dual view.
* Toggle the recolor.
* Remove Battle Stats From Header.
* Remove Battle Tab from actions menu.
* Toggle each quest option in Quest Selection box.
* Edit the colors used by the recolor.
* Toggle Pendoria Logo.
* Toggle each TS in TS Selection box.
* Toggle the TS Selection box & Work button.
* Toggle added height to make up for removed TS selection box.
* Toggle the wallpaper (Pend vs Custom)
