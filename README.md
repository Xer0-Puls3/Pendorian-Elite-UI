# Pendorian Elite UI
Changes a large portion of Pendoria's text and UI to 'Elite' blue and makes small changes to the UI.

Every last feature can be customized or disabled, including the recolor!

A Lot of features are disabled by default, I suggest looking through them for settings you might like.

Created by [Puls3](https://github.com/xPuls3)!

## Features
The settings can be found at the top of the script.
Modify them via your script editor.
* Recolor Everything.
* Frameless Mode.
* Dual View. (Shows content & actions)
* Edit the favicon.
* Edit the background image.
* A legacy looking sidebar.
* Remove the Pendoria logo.
* Make the dungeons tab a sidebar link.
* Move the areas tab into the battle tab.
* Remove the action tabs.
* Remove tradeskill selection dropdown.
* Remove battle stats on the header.
* Custom page bottom links
* It's fully customizable!
* More I probably forgot to mention!

## Notice
Given that Puls3 is a moderator, ~~a tester~~ (I was), and active on the development server, new features will most likely be made compatible before they even arrive on the live game.

If you have any issues using Violentmonkey's 'check for updates' feature and have been using the script since it was on Greasy Fork, then uninstall then reinstall directly from GitHub.
Considering how long ago this was I don't see this being an issue ever again.

## Support
This script is was created for Firefox and only Firefox, not Chrome, not Opera, and not Vivaldi, alternate browser support relies on users reporting errors. Despite this I attempt to provide the best experience across all mainstream browsers.

This script was made for Violentmonkey, though may work on other extensions, if you use Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey, I suggest switching, though it's not required. Greasemonkey users beware, it is the cause of many compatibility issues.

Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, & Safari, all experience native issues inside Pendoria, and are incapable of running correctly - No support is provided to either of them. If you use either you should look into alternatives.

No support is provided to older versions, only the latest releases, this includes older versions of browsers and extensions.

If you have any issues using Violentmonkey's 'check for updates' feature and have been using the script since it was on Greasy Fork or have used a development release, then uninstall it, and reinstall directly from GitHub.
