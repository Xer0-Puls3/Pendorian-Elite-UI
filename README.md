## Installation
* First, download [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/).
* Then go to the Downloads section above, and click the download link.
* Violentmonkey will display a "confirm Installation" button, confirm the installation.
* Refresh Pendoria.

## Notice
A Lot of features are disabled by default, I suggest looking through them for settings you might like.

Given that Puls3 is a tester and active on the development server, new features will most likely be made compatable before they arrive on the live game.

If you have any issues using Violentmonkey's 'check for updates' feature and have been using the script since it was on Greasyfork, then uninstall then reinstall directly from GitHub.

## Support
This script is was created for Firefox, not Chrome, Chrome support relies on users reporting errors.

This script was made for Violentmonkey though may work on other extensions, if you use Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey, I suggest switching, though it's not required.

## Customization
* Open up the Violentmonkey extension.
* Open up the Violentmonkey dashboard.
* Scroll to Pendorian Elite UI and click the edit button.
* Scroll to the [Options] section.
* Customize the values.
