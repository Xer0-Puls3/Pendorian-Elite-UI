# Pendorian Elite UI
Changes a large portion of Pendoria's text and UI to 'Elite' blue and makes small changes to the UI.

Every last feature can be customized or disabled, including the recolor!

A Lot of features are disabled by default, I suggest looking through them for settings you might like.

* Violentmonkey will display a "confirm Installation" button, confirm the installation.
* Refresh Pendoria.

* Scroll to Pendorian Elite UI and click the edit button.
* Scroll to the [Options] section.
* Customize the values.

## Support
This script is was created for Firefox and only Firefox, not Chrome, not Opera, and not Vivaldi, alternate browser support relies on users reporting errors. Despite this I attempt to provide the best experience across all mainstream browsers.

This script was made for Violentmonkey, though may work on other extensions, if you use Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey, I suggest switching, though it's not required. Greasemonkey users beware, it is the cause of many compatibility issues.

Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, & Safari, all experience native issues inside Pendoria, and are incapable of running correctly - No support is provided to either of them. If you use either you should look into alternatives.

No support is provided to older versions, only the latest releases, this includes older versions of browsers and extensions.
