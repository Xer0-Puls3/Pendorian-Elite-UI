# Pendorian Elite UI
Changes a large portion of Pendoria's text and UI to 'Elite' blue and makes small changes to the UI.

Every last feature can be customized or disabled, including the recolor!

A Lot of features are disabled by default, I suggest looking through them for settings you might like.
