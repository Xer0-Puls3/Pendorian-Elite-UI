# Pendorian Elite UI
Changes a large portion of Pendoria's text and UI to 'Elite' blue and makes small changes to the UI.

Every last feature can be toggled, including the recolor!

Legacy releases can be found [here](https://github.com/Xer0-Puls3/Pendorian-Elite-UI/releases).

## Notice
This script can be weird at times when used on Chrome, though easily fixed Puls3 doesn't use Chrome and as such doesn't notice them, remember to report any bugs you find!

If you have any issues using Violentmonkey's 'check for updates' feature and have been using the script since it was on Greasyfork, then uninstall then reinstall directly from GitHub.

A Lot of features are disabled by default, I suggest looking through them for settings you might like.

Given that Puls3 is a tester, most features (without being given away) will be made compatible with this script before their release on the live server.

## Support
This script is was created for Firefox, not Chrome, Chrome support relies on users reporting errors.

This script was made for Violentmonkey though may work on other extensions, if you use Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey, I suggest switching.
