If you have any issues using Violentmonkey's 'check for updates' feature and have been using the script since it was on Greasyfork, then uninstall then re-install directly from Github.

Legacy releases can be found in the releases section on GitHub.

## Notice
This script can be weird at times when used on Chrome, though easily fixed Puls3 doesn't use Chrome and as such doesn't notice them, remember to report any bugs you find!

If you don't like DualView or your Pendoria setup makes it look dumb, disable it!

Alot of features are disabled by default, I suggest looking through them for settings you might like.

## Issues
There are currently no known issues in the current release.
If you find any issues use the issues feature on GitHub using as much detail as possible so that it can be fixed swiftly.
