# Contributing to the Pendorian Elite UI
The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the [Pendorian Elite UI](https://github.com/Xer0-Puls3/Pendorian-Elite-UI). These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Follow The Color Standard
In any recoloration please only contribute colors that fit the default 'Elite' style, if users feel the need to change them they can do so through the recolor module. When contributing to the recolor module be sure to use both the JS variables and the CSS variables to ensure that procedure remains the same.

## Style Your Code
Needless to say, code is hard to read whenever it is not indented and styled correctly. Ensure that your contribution is easy to read and underdstand. Obfuscated code will be completely ignored.

## External Content
Unless pre-approved by the mantainer(s) of the Pendorian Elite UI, please do not link to external content in your contributions.

#### At this time I have no more ideas for what could go here, if you have any suggestions; be sure to let me know!
